# To see what wee hacks can build.
# Development should diverge from main into new mains in all directions
# Each main becomes a starting node for child mains

# I imagine a Mandelbrot of reusable code and applications, free and open

# Starting with a neutral, generic foundation
# 1. Establish standard file and directory structure
# 2. Establish CI / CD process (w/ unit test, linter, etc.)
# 3. Preserve arrangement as a general starting point
#### Not sure how this is accomplished yet

# Create branches which are not intended to merged but are intended to individualize and specialize
# Spawn new mains from foundation
# 2. Construct secondary development
# 3. Preserve state of progress at significant junctures, regression points, access points, etc.
#### Always facilitating interface w/ potential child developments
