# To see what wee hacks can build.
# Development should diverge from main into new mains in all directions
# Create branches which are not ultimately intended to merge but to individualize and specialize.
# Each main becomes a starting node for child mains

# I imagine a Mandelbrot of reusable code and applications, free and open.

# Starting with a neutral, generic foundation
# 1. Establish standard file and directory structure
# 2. Establish CI / CD process (w/ unit test, linter, etc.)
# 3. Preserve arrangement as a general starting point


# 1. Spawn new mains from foundation following CI / CD process.
# 2. Construct secondary developments
# 3. Preserve state of progress at significant junctures, regression points, access points, etc.
#### Always anticipating and facilitating interface w/ potential child developments
